# mm5-layouts
The on-stream graphics used during Mega Manathon 5 (based significantly on the NodeCG layouts for Summer Games Done Quick 2016).

This is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) 0.8 bundle. You will need to have NodeCG 0.8 installed to run it.

## Installation
- Install to `nodecg/bundles/sgdq16-layouts`.
- Install `bower` if you have not already (`npm install -g bower`)
- **WINDOWS**: Install [`windows-build-tools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) to install the tools necessary to compile `sgdq16-layouts`' dependencies.
- **LINUX**: Install `build-essential` and Python 2.7, which are needed to compile `sgdq16-layouts`' dependencies.
- `cd nodecg/bundles/sgdq16-layouts` and run `npm install --production`, then `bower install`
- Create the configuration file (see the [configuration][id] section below for more details)
- Run the nodecg server: `nodecg start` (or `node index.js` if you don't have nodecg-cli) from the `nodecg` root directory.

Please note that you **must manually run `npm install` for this bundle**. NodeCG currently cannot reliably 
compile this bundle's npm dependencies. This is an issue we hope to address in the future.

## Usage
This bundle is not intended to be used verbatim. Many of the assets have been replaced with placeholders, and
most of the data sources are hardcoded. We are open-sourcing this bundle in hopes that people will use it as a
learning tool and base to build from, rather than just taking and using it wholesale in their own productions.

To reiterate, please don't just download and use this bundle as-is. Build something new from it.
